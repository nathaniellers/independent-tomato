# Rancid Tomatillos
This project is typically a paired project in Turing's Mod 3 Front End program, but I worked this project independently over a slightly shorter span of time.
In this project, I created a Single Page Application that displays movie information.

## Learning Goals

In this project, our learning goals were to:

- Solidify React fundamentals
- Solidify using React Router to create a multi-page user experience
- Solidify component and asynchronous JS testing
- Work with and navigate a shared, persistent API using GET, POST, and DELETE requests

# Challenges

This was my first project using React, as well as my first time posting to an API. I have to say, dealing with async functions was a bit tricky.

Simply getting my head wrapped around the new technologies was challenging. I did not get as far in the project as I would have liked.

I was hampered by internet difficulties, which cost me an entire day of work, and also by some interpersonal issues with a classmate, which impacted my self-confidence and definitely slowed my progress.

# Wins

I was able to get some real understanding of how React functions, how components work together and a stong understanding of "Data down, Actions up".

I was able to successfully fetch and post and update state in different components than were the functions were invoked.

By working alone, I was able to feel greater confindence in my abiity to understand and write code independently.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
